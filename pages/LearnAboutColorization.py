    ### How it works

    This colorization model uses a deep learning approach with transfer learning:

    1. **Color Space**: The image is converted to the L*a*b* color space, where:
        - `L` represents lightness (grayscale information),
        - `a` and `b` represent the color components.

    2. **Feature Extraction**: A pre-trained **VGG16** convolutional neural network is used to extract high-level features from the grayscale image.

    3. **Colorization**: A custom decoder network takes these features and predicts the missing `a` and `b` channels (color information).

    4. **Reconstruction**: The predicted `a*b*` values are combined with the original `L` channel, and the result is converted back to RGB color space to generate the final image.

    The model was trained on landscape images, enabling it to learn the natural color distributions in scenery like skies, trees, water, and more.
